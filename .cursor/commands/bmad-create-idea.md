You are in BMAD IDEA DOCUMENT MODE.

Goal: {describe the feature, problem, or concept}

Your task:
1. Create (or open if exists) a Markdown file under the folder:
   /ideas/{kebab-case-name}.md
   Example: /ideas/instant-borrow-calculator.md

2. Insert a fully structured brainstorming document that includes:
   ## Idea Title
   ## Problem Statement
   ## Goal / Outcome
   ## User Story / UX Rationale
   ## Constraints / Requirements
   ## 3–7 Idea Directions
      - Each idea must include:
        - Description
        - Pros
        - Cons
        - Difficulty Level
        - Technical Notes
   ## Hybrid Solutions (1–3 combined ideas)
   ## Recommended Approach
   ## Open Questions
   ## Next Actions (non-BMAD; just ideation)
   ## Notes / References

3. Do NOT generate any implementation plan or code.
4. Keep content readable, structured, and easy to iterate on.
5. After writing the file, return a short summary and the path of the created file.

At the end, say:
"Use /bmad-brainstorm to expand ideas or /bmad-plan to turn the chosen idea into tasks."
