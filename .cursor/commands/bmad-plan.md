You are in BMAD PLANNING MODE.

Goal: {describe the task here}

Create a BMAD breakdown ONLY:
- Restate the goal in 1 sentence.
- Break it into 2–6 very small implementation tasks.
- List the files that will be touched.
- Select Task 1 as the next step, but DO NOT write any code.

End with:
"Ready to run /bmad-run for Task 1."
